    "## Welcome to the First Python Project! \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a simple and interactive game using Python, incorporating fundamental programming concepts and Python basics. This project aims to reinforce your understanding of core Python principles while fostering creativity through game development. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Game options:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Guess the Number:\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it.\n",
    "Provide hints like \"too high\" or \"too low\" after each guess.\n",
    "Include a limited number of attempts and a score system based on accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hangman:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a word bank and randomly select a word for the player to guess.\n",
    "Display the current state of the word with blanks for unrevealed letters.\n",
    "Allow a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tic-Tac-Toe:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.\n",
    "Ensure proper input validation and display the game board after each move.\n",
    "Declare the winner or a draw when the game concludes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Snake Game:\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a classic Snake game using the console.\n",
    "Control the snake with arrow keys, and let it grow longer with each food item.\n",
    "Implement collision detection and keep track of the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note: you can explore implementiong any other game of your choice.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two types of requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Requirements:\n",
    "Technical Requirements are designed to guide you on your project. These will help point you in the right direction as well as show you what we will be looking for when reviewing your project. These requirements will be focused towards the specific coding aspects you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements:\n",
    "Functional Requirements are designed to provoke thought throughout your project. These will be based in theory rather than code. These requirements will assist in shaping your output of each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make sure to read all of the instructions at least twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"border:2px solid\">\n",
    "<h1 style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 3em;\">Project Requirements</h1>\n",
    "<hr style=\"border-top:1px dashed\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use functions to modularize your code and promote code readability.\n",
    "- Implement proper error handling for user inputs to avoid crashes.\n",
    "- Ensure the game provides clear instructions and feedback to the player.\n",
    "- Add comments to explain complex sections of your code.\n",
    "- Create a README file that includes instructions on how to play the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Optional:__ \n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Pygame or Tkinter.\n",
    "- Add sound effects or background music to enhance the gaming experience.\n",
    "- Create additional levels or features to make the game more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will require an assortment of counter variables that will have to be set on a global scale (they exist outside of all functions). It will also be required to use at least two function that you write. I would recommend you create the barebones of the game, then pretty it up. Do not worry about making incredibly detailed print statements and formatting until you finish the base game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide pseudocode and/or flowchart\n",
    "- Write at least Two function\n",
    "- Check the user input for any types of non-numeric answers or those that are not expected by the program (when applicable)\n",
    "- Use several global counters to keep track of user's statistics\n",
    "- Incorporate a Graphic User Interface (GUI)\n",
    "- Code must have comment's explaining what you did following coding style standars and documentaton best practices\n",
